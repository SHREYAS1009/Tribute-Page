             <li> Sripathi Panditaradhyula Balasubrahmanyam (4 June 1946 – 25 September 2020), also referred to as S. P. B. or Balu</li>

              <li>The first non-Telugu song that he recorded just eight days after his debut Telugu song was in Kannada in 1966 for the film Nakkare Ade Swarga, starring Kannada comedy stalwart T. R. Narasimharaju.</li>

                <li>“I know what I am capable of and more importantly, I know what I cannot do.”</li>
                <li>“They compose a song and later ask a singer to come and sing it – not keeping in mind the singer’s unique timbre"</li>
                 <li>“Look at the classicism in these lines. But many songs composed today are more about noise than about music.”</li>                   
                 <li>“Consequently, the sounds are increasingly unfamiliar and the music, alien. I don’t mean to say all songs made today are bad. But a good number is like a rare oasis.”</li>
